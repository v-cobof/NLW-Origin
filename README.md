<div align="center">
 <h1>Unify</h1>
</div>

 The website for a software development company, called "Unify". You can check out the website by clicking <a href="https://v-cobof.github.io/NLW-Origin/">here</a>. It's being hosted on GitHub pages.
 
 The overall design comes from the project developed During Next Level Week by RocketSeat, in the Origin path. I changed the theme to another company, and chose a different set of colors.
